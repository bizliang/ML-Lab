## there is an instance of anaconda navigator already running

Previously my anaconda navigator was not responding so I have rebooted my computer and now when I am trying to open anaconda navigator it pop-ups an error with "there is an instance of anaconda navigator already running".

![anaconda](./image/anaconda.jpg)

```zsh
killall python
```
